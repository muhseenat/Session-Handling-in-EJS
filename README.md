Features:
 1. Login page should accept username and password from the user.
 2. Username and password should be validated at the server side with a predefined value.
 3. If correct, give access to the home page.
 4. If incorrect, display incorrect username or password message on the login page.
 5. Home page should contain a signout button. On click signout button - redirect to login page.
